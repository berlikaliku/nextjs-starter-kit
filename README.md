# nextjs-starter-kit

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) starter kit powered by [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Getting Started

Run the development server with `package manager` of your choice. In this case I'm using [npm](https://npmjs.com/) `v18.12.1` and run the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser and even you can specify the port and hostname used for development server in `package.json` file.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
